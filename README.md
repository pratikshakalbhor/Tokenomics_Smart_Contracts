## 📘 Tokenomics Smart Contracts (Solidity)

This repository contains a collection of **practical Solidity smart contracts** focused on **tokenomics concepts**.
Each contract demonstrates a real-world token mechanism implemented for learning and practice purposes.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen understanding of **ERC-style logic, token supply models, rewards, inflation, and conditional flows** using Solidity.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Fixed token supply
- Supply increase & inflation
- Token airdrops
- Reward calculation (staking-style)
- Token price calculation
- Conditional logic (if/else)
- Loop-based user simulations
- Simple voting logic

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Language: **Solidity**

- Compiler Version: **^0.8.0**

- Environment: **Remix IDE**

- Blockchain Concept: **Ethereum (testnet-ready logic)**

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By completing these contracts, I practiced:

Writing clean and readable Solidity code

Implementing tokenomics logic step by step

Understanding how supply, rewards, and inflation affect tokens

Structuring multiple smart contracts in a single repository
